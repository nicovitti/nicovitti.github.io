		<h1>GD2: VISUAL REFERENCES</h1>
		<h2>01 interactive design portfolio</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/nerval.png">
			<a href="http://nerval.ch">source</a>
			<p>This person's interactive design portfolio page is really awesome. I've been seeing a few examples lately of web design that borrows some of the best ideas from magazine layout. Full-bleed images, for example, that are carefully curated and professional quality.</p>
			<p>Attention to negative space is a big one here. The white stripe across the bottom third of the screen is a wonderful anchor for the page and a great lead-in to horizontal scrolling. It's a 'page-turner' in a digital sense. Mousing over the images lifts them ever so slightly, enough to give you a peek under the white stripe and invite you to click through. It's a portfolio that showcases the designer's work, while serving as a solid example in itself.</p>
		<h2>02 tumblr homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/tumblr.png">
			<a href="http://tumblr.com">source</a>
			<p>Tumblr recently redesigned its homepage from a painfully boring gray-blue to a rotating set of featured images from the microblogs that make up its network. After Yahoo! bought Tumblr, I expected to see some changes. I wondered if the new owners would try to tame it, or perhaps capitalize on the profoundly weird art that is unique to tumblogs.</p>
			<p> The new homepage certainly brings Tumblr's image up-to-date, as photo-based homepages have become very popular. But their choice of images has erred towards the bizarre, which I think is a wonderful tribute to the spirit of Tumblr. I had to refresh the page about ten times before I noticed the slight shadow that allows the log-in fields to remain clear among all the intensely different pagescapes. The image citation isn't noticeable at first, but it's easily found if you look.</p>
		<h2>03 masd homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/masd.png">
			<a href="http://micasocialdesign.com/masd">source</a>
			<p>This is the blog homepage for my grad program, MASD. Mousing over each student&rsquo;s name makes the text turn teal and switch to a word that describes them. It&rsquo;s fun and effectively invites the viewer to click through to each student&rsquo;s individual blog. I do think, however, that it lacks some basic information, like the fact that everyone listed is a student. I remember, actually, looking at this site when I was researching grad programs and being confused about where I was. It&rsquo;s not part of MICA&rsquo;s main website, either, which adds another level of confusion.</p>
		<h2>04 narrative.ly</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/narratively.png">
			<a href="http://narrative.ly">source</a>
			<p>Narrative.ly was the first website I saw with a pleasingly narrow one-column layout. The screenshot above doesn't do their whole site justice. They really use the space afforded by a one-column format well. Like the the interactive design portfolio and Tumblr's homepage (which I discuss above), narrative.ly uses large, high-quality images that are always well balanced with the type. They also use initial caps, an old typographical technique dating back to Ancient Rome. I haven't seen too many web publications take advantage of that.  </p>
		<h2>05 rolling jubilee</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/rolling-jubilee.png">
			<a href="http://rollingjubilee.org">source</a>
			<p>When I first saw the Rolling Jubilee website, I wasn't sure it was real. Not only because the concept of eliminating random people's debt seemed too good to be true, but because the site was impressively...commercial? Despite (or perhaps because of) its resistance to capitalism, the Rolling Jubilee site uses current trends in web design to make their project and vision easily digestable to the average reader. I've felt a strong pull toward one-page sites recently. I think their simplicity and ease of use allows for sophisticated and balanced design while keeping the site's content accessible to people with less experience using computers and the Internet. Additionally, the statistics, the most crucial and admirable element of the site, are center stage. It's a great example of applying capitalist methods to anti-capitalist projects (something I'd like to do more of!).</p>
            <h2>06 caligo</h2>
			<img src="images/visuals/caligo.jpg">
			<a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Caligo-Typeface/11011737">source</a>
			<p>I came across Caligo on a <a href="http://betype.co">type blog</a> and was taken with its swashes. But this example page is truly spectacular. The choice of a lowercase g and k is perfect, and the way the negative intrudes into the letterforms adds a significant level of interest without taking away from the type's readability. There's an extra ornament hanging out on the bottom left there. I'm not sure what it is but it looks like it could be part of another letter. I think it might add some balance to the piece but I don't think I'd be too sad to see it go. I only wish I knew someone with the initials G.K.</p>
        <h2>07 andrew mccarthy</h2>
            <img src="images/visuals/andrew-mccarthy.png">
			<a href="http://andrevv.com/">source</a>
			<p>It's worth clicking through to the source link before hearing anything I have to say about this site. The running cat is a great way to invite the user into the site. I love that he anticipated the user's desire to replay it and simply repeated the design a few times before letting them reach the footer. Even in the footer, there's a link providing an opportunity to go through the animation again. Also, the fact that his cat images are titled catz01, catz02, cracks me up. I have a feeling the z refers to layer ordering in CSS, but I'm going to keep thinking of it as "catz."</p>
        <h2>08 earth wind map</h2>    
            <img src="images/visuals/earth.png">
			<a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">source</a>
			<p>Following a common thread of this little blog, the simplicity of this animation is what appeals to me. There are a lot of scientific connections to be made with weather patterns, but the dynamic appeal of this visualization is enough to make it interesting on its own. I like that it uses not only standard click-and-drag interaction, but scrolling as well (scrolling up zooms in, scrolling down zooms out). All other controls are located in a pop-up menu that the "earth" text in the lower-left links to. I didn't realize the first few times I looked at it that there were any other controls or information. Perhaps I would have realized if there were more visual cues that "earth" is a link, like an underline, or brighter text color. I also think the moving lines are a clear indication of wind, but I wasn't able to determine what the colors represent.</p>

			<p>Scrolling seems to be a popular creative tool with web designers right now. While this site doesn't use parallax scrolling, </p>
