		<h1>GD2: VISUAL REFERENCES</h1>
		<h2>01 interactive design portfolio</h2>
			<img src="images/nerval.png">
			<a href="http://nerval.ch">source</a>
			<p>This person's interactive design portfolio page is really awesome. I've been seeing a few examples lately of web design that borrows some of the best ideas from magazine layout. Full-bleed images, for example, that are carefully curated and professional quality.</p>
			<p>Attention to negative space is a big one here. The white stripe across the bottom third of the screen is a wonderful anchor for the page and a great lead-in to horizontal scrolling. It's a 'page-turner' in a digital sense. Mousing over the images lifts them ever so slightly, enough to give you a peek under the white stripe and invite you to click through. It's a portfolio that showcases the designer's work, while serving as a solid example in itself.</p>
		<h2>02 tumblr homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/tumblr.png">
			<a href="http://tumblr.com">source</a>
			<p>Tumblr recently redesigned its homepage from a painfully boring gray-blue to a rotating set of featured images from the microblogs that make up its network. After Yahoo! bought Tumblr, I expected to see some changes. I wondered if the new owners would try to tame it, or perhaps capitalize on the profoundly weird art that is unique to tumblogs.</p>
			<p> The new homepage certainly brings Tumblr's image up-to-date, as photo-based homepages have become very popular. But their choice of images has erred towards the bizarre, which I think is a wonderful tribute to the spirit of Tumblr. I had to refresh the page about ten times before I noticed the slight shadow that allows the log-in fields to remain clear among all the intensely different pagescapes. The image citation isn't noticeable at first, but it's easily found if you look.</p>
		<h2>03 masd homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/masd.png">
			<a href="http://micasocialdesign.com/masd">source</a>
			<p>This is the blog homepage for my grad program, MASD. Mousing over each student&rsquo;s name makes the text turn teal and switch to a word that describes them. It&rsquo;s fun and effectively invites the viewer to click through to each student&rsquo;s individual blog. I do think, however, that it lacks some basic information, like the fact that everyone listed is a student. I remember, actually, looking at this site when I was researching grad programs and being confused about where I was. It&rsquo;s not part of MICA&rsquo;s main website, either, which adds another level of confusion.</p>
		<h2>04 narrative.ly</h2>
			<img src="images/narratively.png">
			<a href="http://narrative.ly">source</a>
			<p>Narrative.ly was the first website I saw with a pleasingly narrow one-column layout. The screenshot above doesn't do their whole site justice. They really use the space afforded by a one-column format well. Like the the interactive design portfolio and Tumblr's homepage (which I discuss above), narrative.ly uses large, high-quality images that are always well balanced with the type. They also use initial caps, an old typographical technique dating back to Ancient Rome. I haven't seen too many web publications take advantage of that.  </p>
		<h2>05 rolling jubilee</h2>
			<img src="images/rolling-jubilee.png">
			<a href="http://rollingjubilee.org">source</a>
			<p>When I first saw the Rolling Jubilee website, I wasn't sure it was real. Not only because the concept of eliminating random people's debt seemed too good to be true, but because the site was impressively...commercial? Despite (or perhaps because of) its resistance to capitalism,  </p>
