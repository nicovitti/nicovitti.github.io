		<h1>GD2: VISUAL REFERENCES</h1>
		<h2>01 interactive design portfolio</h2>
			<img src="images/nerval.png">
			<p>This person's interactive design portfolio page is really awesome. I've been seeing a few examples lately of web design that borrows some of the best ideas from magazine layout. Full-bleed images, for example, that are carefully curated and professional quality.</p>
			<p>Attention to negative space is a big one here. The white stripe across the bottom third of the screen is a wonderful anchor for the page and a great lead-in to horizontal scrolling. It's a 'page-turner' in a digital sense. Mousing over the images lifts them ever so slightly, enough to give you a peek under the white stripe and invite you to click through. It's a portfolio that showcases the designer's work, while serving as a solid example in itself.</p>
		<h2>02 tumblr homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/tumblr.png">
			<p>Tumblr recently redesigned its homepage from a painfully boring gray-blue to a rotating set of featured images from the microblogs that make up its network. After Yahoo! bought Tumblr, I expected to see some changes. I wondered if the new owners would try to tame it, or perhaps capitalize on the profoundly weird art that is unique to tumblogs.</p>
			<p> The new homepage certainly brings Tumblr's image up-to-date, as photo-based homepages have become very popular. But their choice of images has erred towards the bizarre, which I think is a wonderful tribute to the spirit of Tumblr. I had to refresh the page about ten times before I noticed the slight shadow that allows the log-in fields to remain clear among all the intensely different pagescapes. The image citation isn't noticeable at first, but it's easily found if you look.</p>
		<h2>03 masd homepage</h2>
			<img src="images/masd.png">
			<p>This is the blog homepage for my grad program, MASD. Mousing over each student&rsquo;s name makes the text turn teal and switch to a word that describes them. It&rsquo;s fun and it works to invite the viewer to click through to each student&rsquo;s individual blog. I do think, however, that it lacks some basic information, like the fact that everyone listed is a student. I remember, actually, looking at this site when I was researching grad programs and being confused about where I was. It&rsquo;s not part of MICA&rsquo;s main website, either, which adds another level of confusion.</p>
